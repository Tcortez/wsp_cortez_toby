                <p>Gone are the days when a computer was an unusual item in the home. Many homes now have more than one machine, with a mix of PCs, 
                Macs, desktop computers and laptops.</p>

				<p>Home users do not always approach security, anti-virus and maintenance in the same way as their office-based counterparts, although 
                we'd argue that they should.</p>
                
                <p>We can solve all of your technical problems. Whether you're a home user with a slow computer, a teenager with a broken laptop or a
                 business who require a laptop or desktop motherboard repair. Our services aim to cater for a broad spectrum of the market, whilst
                 providing an honest, well priced repair.</p>
                 
                 <p>Let us show you how to get the most from your home computers, and keep you and your family safe from online threats.</p>

                <p>Why not have one of the VISTA COMPUTER (a computer repair company Orlando) team visit your home to take a look at your home computer
                 set-up?  Or for that matter the office setup in home or storefront. We can advise on upgrades, maintenance security and back up.</p>

				<p>The vast majority of companies that we visit on a daily basis do not have any backup in place. What would happen if you lost all of
                 your files overnight , are you covered. Then if not Data Recovery is your last option.</p>

            	<p>A computer system needs looking after, whether it's based at work or at home. Its like a car it will need maintenance to keep running
                 and be safe.</p>
